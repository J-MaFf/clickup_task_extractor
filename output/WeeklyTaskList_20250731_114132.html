Dear {{First name}},

We recently created a new app server for JFC Atlanta that is faster, runs newer software, etc. I was tasked with helping migrate users to this new server. Please start using the JAT 2019 APP Server from now on. Some users have already started using the new app server. If this is the case, you can continue using the new server. I will transfer your files from the old server shortly.

If you are still using the old server, please log in to the new one so I can start transferring your files. Once all users have connected to the server and I have moved all the files, we will shut down the old app server.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Good afternoon. I wanted to contact you about a specific program you have installed on your desktop, Cisco AnyConnect VPN. This program is usually reserved for laptops, and I have been asked to contact desktop users who have the VPN installed.

If you don&#x27;t use this program, great! If you do, you need to let me know. I will uninstall Cisco AnyConnect from all desktops EXCEPT for users who tell me they use/need it.

Thank you for reading and responding to this email. I will start the removals next week.

</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Windows Hello (for passkeys)</td><td>KMS</td><td>KMS CA (?)</td><td></td><td>investigating</td><td></td><td>Subject: Windows Hello (for passkeys)
Description: Objective: To propose and evaluate the lifting of Group Policy (GP) restrictions on &quot;Windows Hello&quot; to facilitate smoother passkey adoption and improve user login experience.
Background: Currently, Group Policy restrictions prevent users from fully utilizing Windows Hello features (fingerprint, PIN, security key, etc.) for authentication. As an early adopter of Windows Hello on my company laptop, I&#x27;ve experienced firsthand the convenience and security benefits of using a fingerprint scanner for login. Removing these restrictions is expected to simplify the passkey adoption process, making it more accessible and user-friendly for employees.
Proposed Action:
Lift Group Policy Restrictions: Apply the necessary Group Policy changes to enable Windows Hello functionality for a select group of users. I am familiar with the process for lifting these GP restrictions.
Pilot Program: Implement a small-scale pilot program with a subset of users to test the impact of the lifted restrictions.
Gather Feedback: Collect qualitative and quantitative feedback from pilot users regarding their experience with Windows Hello and passkey adoption.
Report Findings: Compile a comprehensive report detailing the pilot&#x27;s findings, including user feedback, any technical issues encountered, and recommendations for broader deployment.
Desired Outcome: A clear understanding of the benefits and potential challenges associated with enabling Windows Hello company-wide, with the ultimate goal of streamlining passkey adoption and enhancing overall user security and convenience.
Request: I would like to propose initiating a pilot program with a small group of users to evaluate the impact of lifting the Windows Hello Group Policy restrictions. Upon completion, I will report back with my findings and recommendations.


Resolution: Thursday, July 3, 2025 @ 10:17 AM:
I sent Hide my proposal:
On another note, I think it would be a good idea to lift the group policy restrictions regarding &quot;Windows Hello&quot;. This would allow users to utilize the fingerprint scanners on their laptops. In cases where a fingerprint scanner is not available, a PIN, security key, or another authentication method can be used. This would make passkey adoption a much simpler and smoother process for users. When I started working here, one of the first things I did for my laptop was set up Windows Hello, allowing me to utilize the fingerprint scanner. I know how to lift the GP restrictions.

What do you think? Could I try it out with a few users and report back to you?
3:42 PM:
Hide agreed to my proposal. I will create a test OU and get to work.
 Friday, July 18, 2025, @ 3:59 PM:
I just did a proof of concept with Gabe, and it works great! All the user will have to do is type in their PIN, scan their fingerprint, or use another one of Windows Hello&#x27;s methods!
 Wednesday, July 23, 2025, @ 4:00 PM:
Okay, here is the status. I have completed creating the group policy; it currently works with Windows computers and RDP, but not WYSE terminals. Tomorrow, I will deploy the GPO to all domains, but only for Windows computers. After that, I will work on the GPO for WYSE terminals.
 Thursday, July 24, 2025 @ 2:31 PM:
I have the GPO deployed for KFI, JFC, and KMS. I just did some research into whether or not &quot;expired passwords&quot; would mess with the Windows Hello implementation, and I am happy to say it will not.
3:03 PM:
I just implemented the GPO on the KSU domain. Now I am creating a guide for users on how to set up Windows Hello, create a passkey, and use passkeys.
 Wednesday, July 30, 2025 @ 11:01 AM:

Description: Gabe and I sometimes use the &#x27;ping&#x27; command to check if computers are on the network when we cannot make a TightVNC connection to them. Sometimes, we cannot ping devices on the network because of these firewall rules in the image. If these are enabled, then we can ping them. I found a way to turn this on for multiple computers using Group Policy. 

Resolution: I created a test OU and placed a computer inside of it. I set the group policy only to affect that computer.

Update 11/22:
The group policy did what it was supposed to and had no adverse effects. Therefore, I am now applying it to the KFI domain. I plan to do the other domains soon.
